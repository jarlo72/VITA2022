                    <p class="ContentParagraph">A general workflow was conceived during the project planning phase. The plan would be to achieve objectives and produce deliverables in logical sequence.
                        A file geodatabase would be created first to establish that centralized data hub from which all data can be processed and published from. 
                        From there, the workflows to develop the Interactive Web-Map and Offline Viewing Solution can be established concurrently to maximize time / scheduling.

                    with a few loop-backs for either improving or editing particular objectives and follows with the Interactive Web Map in the latter.</p>

                            <p>Thew following descriptions are a brief overview of what has been utilized in this deliverable; that is, <strong>File Geodatabase</strong> and <strong>Spatial Analysis and Data Preprocessing</strong>.</p>
                            <h5>File Geodatabase</h5>
                            <p class="ContentParagraph"> The File Geoadatabase portion was done with esris' ArcGIS Pro software. Data from the client was collected and imported to an ArcGIS Pro Project
                                where they would be exported to the default one that is created. Afterwards, Qiality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) was done on the data to make sure it was as user-
                                friendly and readable as possible, using the clients requests. This includes modifying the datas' attribute tables and its columns, rows, and values, and metadata.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Spatial Analysis and Data Preprocessing</h5>
                            <p class="ContentParagraph"> The Data Preprocessing portion involved taking what was previously mentioned in the first paragraph and editing the data according to Vancouver Island Trail Assoications'
                                (VITA) preferences. The data preprocessing portion invloved two parts. The first part was projecting all data to the local provinces projection and datum, i.e. NAD 1983 BC Environment Albers. The second part was
                                clipping all the data to the extent of Vancouver Island.
                            </p>
                            <p class="ContentParagraph"> The Spatial Analysis portion involved taking the projected and clipped data and doing some analysis on the data. Firstly, merging was done to the geology data as they were split into two for
                                the whole island; this was done to reduce repetition of data and make it more readable. Lastly, generalizing of contours and streams was done by removing incremetns and lengths less than a threshold our client
                                had sepcified.

                <article class="ContentParagraph">
                    <h3 class="underlineTitle">Interactive Web Map</h3> 
                    <p>The web map would involve developing the necessary web infrastructure in order to create a stand-alone web map application</p>
                    
                    <!-- Template for content with text and big image below -->
                    <h4>Workflow Chart</h4>
                    <p class="ContentParagraph">Development of the interactive web-map would follow directly after the geodatabase which would provide the processed data layers. 
                        It largely followed a linear sequence of events as depicted below</p>

                            <p class="ContentParagraph">The process illustrated in the flowchart above makes use of <b>Web technologies</b>, <b>Cartographic Visualization Principles</b> and <b>Web Programming</b> to bring the interactive web map to life.</p>
                            <h5>Web Technologies</h5>
                            <p class="ContentParagraph">ArcGIS Online (AGOL) would be used as the primary Software-as-a-Service Product, being used as the cloud infrastructure to manage and consume the data layers into a 3-dimensional web-scene.
                                ArcGIS Platform would be used to bring Esri mapping tools, data and location services into the web-map as interactivity features to enhance user experience and embed the web-scene onto a standalone Web Map application (see programming below).
                                GitHub would be used as the hosting platform for this web map application.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Programming</h5>
                            <p class="ContentParagraph">Web-coding would use ArcGIS API for JavaScript to enable interactivity features and embed the web-scene as a stand-alone web map application onto an HTML webpage. 
                                HTML + CSS coding would be used for additional formatting that would aid in bolstering cartographic visualization of the user interface.

               <!-- Start of Offline Viewing Functionality -->
                <article class="ContentParagraph">
                    <h3 class="underlineTitle">Solution for Offline Viewing</h3> 
                    <p>The offline viewing solution involves creating downloadable files that can be access on an offline capable navigation app such as 
                    <i>Avenza Maps: Offline Mapping</i> on a mobile device (smart phone)</p>
                    
                    <!-- Workflow for this deliverable -->
                    <h4>Workflow Diagram</h4>
                    <p>Development of the Offline Viewing resources would follow directly after the geodatabase, with reference with the interactive web 
                    map to keep consistancy with the symbologies and stylings between the two parts. It is a mostly linear process, with a small section of iterative steps 
                    as a part of the whole proces. It involves finding the optimal methods of creating files from the geodatabase to the offline navigations maps operating 
                    on the <i>Avenza Maps: Offline Mapping</i> mobile app.</p>

                            <h5>Data Acquisition and Processing</h5>
				                <p class="ContentParagraph">ArcGIS Pro is used to group and convert layers into KMZ format using the "Layer to KML" tool from the ArcGIS Pro Toolbox, after they are symbolized correctly. These files carries different 
                                projection (WGS1984) from the geodatabase. And thus needs to make sure that there are no incompatiblity with PDF base maps which has different projection.
                                </p>
                            <h5>Cartographic Visualization Principles</h5>
                            	<p class="ContentParagraph">PDF base maps are produced with "Export Layout" function in ArcGIS Pro. Layers are styled and symbolized the same way as the interactive web map to keep consistancy, before conversion.
