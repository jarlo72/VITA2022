                        <p class="ContentParagraph"> The Vancouver Island Trail Association, or VITA, (<a href="https://vi-trail.ca/" target="_blank">see VI-trail.ca</a>) is a non-profit organization based in Victoria, British Columbia. The association has developed 98% of the 800-kilometre Vancouver Island Trail, spanning the
                            entirety of Vancouver Island, from Victoria to Cape Scott. The association hopes to connect communities and foster an environment of inquisitive exploration amongst tourists, hikers and
                            nature enthusiasts alike.
                        </p>
                        <p>VITA wishes to increase the accessibility of the Vancouver Island Trail by informing prospective
                            and actual hikers of the trail by providing accessible trail relevant spatial data. However, they feel their current map offerings (consist of static maps and GPX files) are insufficient in this regard and they current have no dedicated spatial database or Geographic Information System (GIS)
                            to facilitate their mapping / spatial needs. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="ContentParagraph">A foundational Geographic Information System (GIS) in the form of a web-map to serve as a centralized data hub for all Vancouver Trail relevant data with the following considerations:
                            <ol class="ContentParagraph">
                                <li>No / Low Cost to develop, deploy and maintain</li>

                                <li>Easy to use, maintain and update for personnel with limited GIS experience</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Interactivity and scale-dependency to facilitate the user's experience</li>

                        <p>The <b>Vancouver Island Trail Mapping and GIS Collaborative Project</b> from the 2022 Fleming GIS Applications Specialist Program project aims find a solution(s) that addresses these needs.

                    <h3 class="underlineTitle">Project Description</h3>
                    <div><h4>Objectives / Deliverables</h4> 
                        <p> To meet those needs, the Vancouver Island and Trail Mapping & GIS project had set to achieve the following objectives and deliverables: 
                            <ol>
                                <li>A File Geodatabase that withholds the data for this project, as well as the preprocessing and spatial analysis workflows.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>An Interactive Web Map (as the online solution) to showcase various trail relevant spatial features and provides user's an enhanced viewing experience which assists potential/regular hikers in planning their hikes.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Map Data for offline viewing in mobile applications (offline solution) that reflects the web map but in an offline form so users have access to trail information in areas of low / no cell coverage.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Documentation to facilitate project handover to VITA</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p></div>
                        <div><h4>Overall Summary</h4> 
                            <p> Project development occurred over a 6-week period from May 16 to June 22, 2022. 
                                In that time, the collaboration group was able to establish a file geodatabase to manage VITA’s spatial data, develop an interactive web-map to showcase Vancouver Island Trail and produce the map data and workflow for offline viewing in mobile applications. 
                                The functionality of these deliverables has been validated by the Collaboration Project Group and VITA and will undergo the project handover process. Overall objectives were achieved yet there is great potential for further development of this project. 
                                Successful implementation of the products developed in this project will be a major milestone in the establishment of the Vancouver Island Trail with hopes that it will contribute greatly to the effort in connecting communities across Vancouver Island.
